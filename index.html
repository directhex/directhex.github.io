<a name="TAFKAYOS" class="anchor" href="#TAFKAYOS"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Artist Formerly Known As Ye Olde SteamOSe</h2>

<p>SteamOS is now shipping, in beta form at least, and it's all cool and stuff.</p>

<p>Valve have now integrated most of the improvements from Ye Olde SteamOSe, such as BIOS and DVD support, into their installer. You can download it from <a href="http://repo.steampowered.com/download/SteamOSDVD.iso">here</a>.</p>

<p>Stephenson's Rocket replaces the Ye Olde SteamOSe project by building back on Valve's installer with bug fixes and improvements - especially hardware support.</p>

<p>This kind of collaborative development demonstrates the power of Open Source - and remember, you can contribute to Stephenson's Rocket too! Click "View on GitHub" at the top of the screen to get started, and watch the development tutorial video linked below!</p>

<h2>
<a name="improvements" class="anchor" href="#improvements"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Improvements</h2>

<ul>
<li>SteamOS only supports Realtek networking, or firmware-free networking. Stephenson's Rocket supports everything a modern Linux does, including WiFi.</li>
<li>SteamOS monopolizes drives. Stephenson's Rocket can resize NTFS partitions.</li>
<li>SteamOS only supports basic partitions. Stephenson's Rocket supports LVM and RAID.</li>
<li>SteamOS requires a Radeon 5000 or newer for ATI users. Stephenson's Rocket will use the Open Source driver instead on older cards.</li>
<li>SteamOS is only updated when Valve have time. Stephenson's Rocket comes with the tools to update it with the latest stuff yourself!</li>
</ul><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/a3jnZ6r.png" alt="SteamOS running in VMWare Workstation 10"></p>

<h2>
<a name="planned-improvements" class="anchor" href="#planned-improvements"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Planned improvements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Support NVIDIA cards no longer supported in current nvidia-glx driver.</li>
<li>Support NVIDIA cards using the new 2014 Maxwell architecture, including the GTX 750 series, with the 334.21 driver.</li>

<h3>Latest release: 1.0 93plus1 (released 2014-03-21)</h3>

<h3><a href="magnet:?xt=urn:btih:9595148135cf98ce94e2e5610c4565c559beea36&dn=StephensonsRocket93plus1.iso&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.publicbt.com%3A80&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.ccc.de%3A80&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.istole.it%3A80">Magnet</a></h3>

<h3><a href="http://retro.apebox.org/StephensonsRocket93plus1.iso.torrent">Torrent</a></h3>

<p>To get started, download the torrent above.</p>

<p>Otherwise, clone this repo, and run gen.sh.</p>

<h4>Installing from a DVD</h4>

<p>Just burn the ISO to a blank DVD from your favourite tool, and boot it.</p>

<h4>Installing from USB (Mac)</h4>

<p>Open a Terminal window from the Utilities section of Applications.</p>

<p>Type &quot;diskutil list&quot; to get a list of devices - one of them will be your USB stick (e.g. /dev/disk2). Follow the Linux instructions below, with this /dev/rdiskX entry instead of /dev/sdX (please note the added "r"!)</p>

<h4>Installing from USB (Linux)</h4>

<p>As root (e.g. use &quot;sudo&quot;) run &quot;dd bs=1M if=/path/to/rocket.iso of=/dev/sdX&quot; - sdX should be the USB stick device (check &quot;dmesg&quot; immediately after plugging it in, you should see the device. Be sure to use sdX, not sdX1 or sdX2. Then boot into the stick.</p>

<h4>Installing from USB (Windows)</h4>

<p>Download <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/">Win32 Disk Imager</a> and use it to copy the .iso to your USB stick (1GB minimum size).</p>

<h4>Once the installer is up...</h4>

<p>Pick the "Automatic Install" option to wipe the first hard disk in your system and install SteamOS to it.</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/5Cy8RUKMXyI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>For more sophisticated booting - e.g. dual-boot or custom partition sizes - select the "Expert" option. Use of this mode is documented in the support video above.</p>

<p>Beyond that, just follow Valve's instructions from <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/steamos/buildyourown">their site</a> - Stephenson's Rocket should behave <i>exactly</i> like the real SteamOS, except it works on more systems</p>

<h2>
<a name="known-issues" class="anchor" href="#known-issues"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Known issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>3D support is broken in Big Picture Mode itself and in 32-bit games in VirtualBox. This is a flaw in the Debian packaging of the VirtualBox guest drivers.</li>
<li>Crashes and strange behaviours on NVIDIA Maxwell cards with certain OpenGL games and applications. This requires an update to the lastest driver to fix, which has not yet been packaged for APT.</li>
  
</ul>
